# BS 3693B:1964 Digitization

This repository contains a digitization of the digits as laid out in the British Standard BS 3693B:1964, along with punctuation marks. The typeface is available as a TrueType font and includes the digits as an OpenType feature.

## Digits

The core of this project is the faithful reproduction of the digits as defined in the standard, available in both proportional and tabular styles. You can access these styles through OpenType features.

### Proportional Digits

To access the proportional digits, you can use the `prop` feature.

### Tabular Digits

To access the tabular digits, you can use the `tabular` feature.

## Punctuation

The punctuation marks are also included in the typeface, but please note that these are not part of the standard BS 3693B:1964 and should be used with caution. The punctuation marks are included for the convenience of users and are not defined in the standard.

## Extrapolated characters

This repository also includes an extrapolated version with ASCII Latin characters (also ones with diacritics). 

### ASCII Latin Characters

The extrapolated version of ASCII Latin characters (also ones with diacritics) is available.
These characters are not part of the standard BS 3693B:1964 and should be used with caution.

## Usage

* Font Installation: Install the TrueType font file in your system's font directory.
* OpenType Feature Access: Use the OpenType feature to access the BS 3693B:1964 digits.
* Extrapolated Version: Use the extrapolated version for a wider range of characters.
